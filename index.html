                <p>The 52 Hz whale is a special whale of an unknown species that has an unusual frequency.
                    The frequency of
                    this sound is much higher than the frequency of other whales that have the same migration pattern as
                    this whale (for example, the frequency of the sound of the blue whale is between 10 and 39 Hz and
                    the frequency of the sound of the brown whale or the fin fish "whales found on the coast of the
                    Atlantic
                    Ocean" is 20 Hz).
                    The 52 Hz whale has been heard intermittently in many places since the late 1980s,
                    and it appears to be the only whale that produces sound waves at this frequency.
                    This whale is known as "the loneliest whale in the world" and is very beautiful and sad.</p>
